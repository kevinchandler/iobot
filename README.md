Roles
=====
Checking for a certain role is easy!
We can get the user's role before executing any code by checking inside the ***msg*** object
```
  robot.respond /nest (s|set) (\d{2}).*/i, (msg) ->
    if 'nest' in msg.message.user.roles
      // change nest temperature
    else
      // talk to an admin
```

Setting a role is also easy! (Must be admin)
```
iobot *username* has nest role
>> Ok, *username* has the 'nest' role.

iobot *username* doesn't have nest role
>> Ok, *username* doesn't have 'nest' role.
```
